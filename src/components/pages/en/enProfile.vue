                    J. School, an independent K-12 boarding school opened by
                    Shanghai Qishun Education Group is located in Jieshou, Anhui
                    Province, China. The school campus is equipped with
                    fantastic facilities, including football field, tennis
                    courts, basketball courts, swimming pool, and other sports
                    fields. Teachers in J. school are caring, professional, and
                    experienced. We maintain small size classes to guarantee
                    that each of the students is receiving enough attention from
                    the teachers. Through Qishun group, J. School is supported
                    with rich educational resources both from overall China and
                    from overseas.

                    Most of the management team members in J. school have an
                    education background of Harvard University (HGSE),
                    University of California – Los Angeles,University of
                    Pittsburgh or Tokyo University, etc. On the management team
                    there are also experienced leading teachers whose previous
                    students have achieved very high scores in Gaokao – the
                    Entrance Exam for College and University in China, which in
                    some aspects is considered to be the toughest exam in the

                    Our goal in J. School is to help students to succeed not
                    only in Gaokao, but also in a more balanced evaluation
                    system, i.e. to provide students opportunities to grow with
                    wider horizon and a global vision, especially in a city like
                    Jieshou. In Jieshou, the education resource is scarce.
                    Students can hardly receive any educational support from the
                    society or their families. School is the only place they can
                    get access to a good education, and J. School is that place.

                    To make dreams come true, what we do in J. School is to
                    create a hybrid education model. We adopt strict rules and
                    school policy that students have to follow, which is
                    necessary in Jieshou to maintain a good learning environment
                    on campus. We build up partnership with schools and
                    educational organizations from Shanghai, Beijing and
                    overseas and introduce various to our campus to help
                    students understand the world better. We use up-to-date
                    educational hi-tech to realizepersonalized learning. We also
                    provide scholarship to students who cannot afford the
                    tuitions. All in all, learning in J. school is intensive but
                    fascinating;the curriculumis academic-focused but
                    well-rounded; and student life is rigid but fully-supported.

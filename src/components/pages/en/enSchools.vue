                                            In J. School, we are trying to
                                            utilize the technology of artificial
                                            intelligence and deep learning to
                                            personalize the learning for each
                                            student and hence boost the learning
                                            efficiency. In doing so, students
                                            will be able to spend less time on
                                            repeated practice while maintain
                                            good results on tests.
